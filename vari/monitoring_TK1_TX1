# TK1

To monitor GPU utilization I just view the current load of the GPU by checking in on this file.

1.    cat /sys/devices/platform/host1x/gk20a.0/load

If I want to monitor it, I use watch with the file.

2.    watch -n 1 cat /sys/devices/platform/host1x/gk20a.0/load

# TX1

Those INA's are not yet supported in the software. After production release of the individual module, they may or may not be enabled.
The nvidia-smi / NVML has not historically been implemented on Tegra platforms.

Newer revisions of the TX1 module enable the use of INA power monitors, see:
